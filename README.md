# Real-Time Detection of Helmet Violations and Capturing Bike Numbers from Number Plates

## Introduction

The real-time detection of helmet violations and capturing bike numbers from number plates is a comprehensive project that aims to enhance road safety by addressing two critical aspects:

1. **Helmet Violation Detection**: This component of the project focuses on identifying motorcycle riders who are not wearing helmets. It uses computer vision techniques to analyze real-time camera feeds and instantly alerts authorities when a violation is detected.

2. **Capturing Bike Numbers**: The second component involves recognizing number plates and extracting number plate information from vehicles in real-time. This feature is valuable for law enforcement.
